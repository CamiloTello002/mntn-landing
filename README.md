## ✨ Why This Project Matters
I built this landing page to demonstrate mastery of responsive layout, custom styling without frameworks, and clean semantic HTML structure—critical frontend skills that are easily overlooked in templated or framework-heavy projects.

It serves as a focused example of:

- Visual hierarchy and content flow

- Mobile-first responsive strategies

- Custom animations and interactive elements (like subtle bounce on scroll indicators)

- Accessible font loading and typography pairing

## 📁 Features

- 💡 CSS @layer usage for organized and scalable styling

- 🔄 Fully responsive layout down to small screens

- ✍️ Custom typography via Google Fonts (Poppins + PT Serif)

- 🎯 Semantic, accessible HTML5 structure

- 💻 No JS required – pure HTML/CSS interactivity

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- Modern CSS (Custom Properties, @layer, media queries, animations)
- No frameworks, no dependencies – built from scratch
