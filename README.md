## ✨ Why This Project Matters
I built this landing page to demonstrate mastery of responsive layout, custom styling without frameworks, and clean semantic HTML structure—critical frontend skills that are easily overlooked in templated or framework-heavy projects.

It serves as a focused example of:

- Visual hierarchy and content flow

- Mobile-first responsive strategies

- Custom animations and interactive elements (like subtle bounce on scroll indicators)

- Accessible font loading and typography pairing
